# Alexa-Databse-Tool

In this new era of technological advancement of human kind, we have made a
vast number of advancements and exchange enormous amount of data every
passing minute of a day. Nearly "2.5 quintillion bytes of data have been
created worldwide in each day of 2017" . It can be a very difficult task
to convert the data into useful information. To address this issue, a voice
service with the help of AWS framework is used to make a tool which can
make the data more useful and prediction easier. The voice service used
is Alexa in the application and we are using Lambda service to write our
back-end code. Our application totally works using cloud-based services. A
voice-based application which can converse with user is made and it acts as
a database search tool which can allter the data on the basis of user input.
With the advancement in Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning, there
is a significant growth in Natural language processing and that makes our
machines really smart and convenient to interact with users . NLP is
the cognitive computing component focused on linguistics and language's
classification and makes Alexa more easy to understand human spoken words.
It helps the machines to learn fast with time. This application is mostly data
independent and will work on any CSV file of some particular format. There
is also a one page interface created to store the file in S3 database, so that
Alexa will be able to use it and all this happens in real time. Further user
can save that filtered data in data file in S3 and can view it later on.
